The applicant union alleged that the obligation to amend its constitution in order to prevent its dissolution constituted an interference with its right to freedom of association as provided for by Article 11 of the Convention .	applicant_union-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 obligation_to_amend_its_constitution-##LKIF:Obligation right_to_freedom_of_association-Freedom_of_association##wordnet_human_right_105176846 Article_11_of_the_Convention-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_11_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles
This provision reads as follows :	provision-##wordnet_provision_106755947
“ 1 .	
Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others , including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests .	right_to_freedom_of_peaceful_assembly-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly##wordnet_human_right_105176846 freedom_of_association-Freedom_of_association##wordnet_human_right_105176846 right-##wordnet_right_105174653

A .	
Whether there was an interference	interference-##wordnet_hindrance_103520811
43 .	
In the applicant union’s submission – not disputed by the Government – the proceedings brought against it constituted an interference by the national authorities in the exercise of its right to freedom of association , and that interference deprived it of the possibility of pursuing collectively or individually the aims that it had laid down in its constitution .	applicant_union’s_submission-##wordnet_submission_106772094 Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Turkey##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding interference-##wordnet_hindrance_103520811 national_authorities-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_national_authority right_to_freedom_of_association-Freedom_of_association##wordnet_human_right_105176846 interference-##wordnet_hindrance_103520811

B .	
Whether the interference was justified	interference-##wordnet_hindrance_103520811
44 .	
The Court reiterates that such interference breaches Article 11 of the Convention unless it is “prescribed by law” , pursues one or more of the legitimate aims under PARAGRAPH_REF of that provision , and is “necessary in a democratic society” in order to fulfil those aims .

Legitimate aim

In the Court’s opinion , the impugned interference pursued a number of legitimate aims , namely the prevention of disorder or the protection of national security , which includes the protection of the State’s territorial integrity .	impugned_interference-##wordnet_hindrance_103520811

“Necessary in a democratic society”	
( a ) Relevant general principles	
47 .	
Whilst referring to the general principles that are enshrined in its relevant case-law-##wordnet_case_law_106535035 in matters of freedom of association ( see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [ GC ] , no . 44158/98 , SECTION REF , ECHR 2004‑I , and the references cited therein , and Association Rhino and Others v. Switzerland , no . 48848/07 , SECTION REF , 11 October 2011 ) , the Court reiterates that the right enshrined in Article 11 includes the right to form an association .	freedom_of_association-Freedom_of_association##wordnet_human_right_105176846 Gorzelik_and_Others_v._Poland_[_GC_]_,_no_._44158/98_,_SECTION_REF_,_ECHR_2004‑I-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case Association_Rhino_and_Others_v._Switzerland_,_no_._48848/07_,_SECTION_REF_,_11_October_2011-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 right-##wordnet_right_105174653 Article_11-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_11_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles right_to_form_an_association-Freedom_of_association##wordnet_human_right_105176846
That citizens should be able to form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most important aspects of the right to freedom of association , without which that right would be deprived of any meaning ( see Sidiropoulos and Others v. Greece , 10 July 1998 , SECTION REF , Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998‑IV ) .	citizens-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person legal_entity-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_personality right_to_freedom_of_association-Freedom_of_association##wordnet_human_right_105176846 right-Freedom_of_association##wordnet_human_right_105176846 Sidiropoulos_and_Others_v._Greece_,_10_July_1998_,_SECTION_REF_,_Reports_of_Judgments_and_Decisions_1998‑IV-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
48 .	
The Court further reiterates that the way in which national legislation enshrines this freedom and its practical application by the authorities reveal the state of democracy in the country concerned .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 national_legislation-##wordnet_law_106532330 authorities-##wordnet_authority_105176607
It can be seen from the Court’s Court’s_case-law-##wordnet_case_law_106535035 that it has repeatedly referred to the direct relationship that exists between democracy , pluralism and freedom of association , and it has established the principle that only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restrictions on freedom of association .	democracy-Democracy##wordnet_political_system_108367880 pluralism-##wordnet_pluralism_108367683 freedom_of_association-Freedom_of_association##wordnet_human_right_105176846 freedom_of_association-Freedom_of_association##wordnet_human_right_105176846
All such restrictions are subject to rigorous supervision ( see , among many other authorities , United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey , 30 January 1998 , SECTION REF‑45 , Reports 1998‑I ; Socialist Party and Others v. Turkey , 25 May 1998 , SECTION REF , Reports 1998‑III ; and Refah Partisi ( the Welfare Party ) and Others v. Turkey [ GC ] , nos . 41340/98 , 41342/98 , 41343/98 and 41344/98 , SECTION REF , ECHR 2003‑II ) .

49 .	
Consequently , in determining whether a necessity within the meaning of Article 11 SECTION_REF exists , the States have only a limited margin of appreciation , which goes hand in hand with rigorous European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it , including those given by independent courts .	Article_11-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_11_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles States-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state law-##wordnet_law_106532330 independent_courts-##wordnet_court_103649459
50 .	
Moreover , the Court reiterates that when it carries out its scrutiny , its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 11 the decisions they delivered in the exercise of their discretion .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 relevant_national_authorities-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_national_authority Article_11-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_11_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles
This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably , carefully and in good faith ; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient” .	State-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state case-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case national_authorities-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_national_authority
In so doing , the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and , moreover , that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ( see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others , cited above , SECTION_REF ; Yazar and Others v. Turkey , nos . 22723/93 , 22724/93 and 22725/93 , SECTION REF , ECHR 2002‑II ; and Sidiropoulos and Others , cited above , SECTION_REF ) .

( b ) Application of the above-mentioned principles to the present case	present_case-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
51 .	
In the present case , the Court notes that two sets of dissolution proceedings were brought against Eğitim-Sen-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_and_Science_Workers'_Union_(Turkey)##wordnet_applicant_109607280 on the ground that , under Article 2 ( b ) of its constitution , the union was defending the idea of education in a person’s “mother tongue” .	present_case-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 dissolution_proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding Article_2_(_b_)-##wordnet_article_106392935 constitution-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution “mother_tongue”-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language
As regards the first set of proceedings , the public prosecutor decided to discontinue them on the ground that the objectives mentioned in the impugned Article were not in breach of the law .	first_set_of_proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding public_prosecutor-##wordnet_prosecutor_110484858 Article-##wordnet_article_106392935 law-##wordnet_law_106532330
Subsequently , at the request of the Chief of Staff of the armed forces , a second set of dissolution proceedings was initiated on the same ground against Eğitim-Sen-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_and_Science_Workers'_Union_(Turkey)##wordnet_applicant_109607280 .	Chief_of_Staff_of_the_armed_forces-##LKIF:Public_Body dissolution_proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
Following those proceedings and the judgment of the Court of Cassation , Eğitim-Sen-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_and_Science_Workers'_Union_(Turkey)##wordnet_applicant_109607280 amended Article 2 ( b ) of its constitution by removing the impugned wording in order to avoid its dissolution by the national courts .

52 .	
It is now for the Court to assess whether that second set of proceedings for the dissolution of Eğitim-Sen-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_and_Science_Workers'_Union_(Turkey)##wordnet_applicant_109607280 met a “pressing social need” and was “necessary in a democratic society” to fulfil the “legitimate aims pursued” .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 second_set_of_proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
53 .	
The Court notes that the Employment Tribunal and the combined divisions of the Court of Cassation did not approach and interpret Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention in the same manner .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 Employment_Tribunal-NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Turkish_employment_tribunal##LKIF:Public_Body Court_of_Cassation-Court_of_Cassation_(Turkey)##wordnet_court_103649459 Articles_10_and_11_of_the_Convention-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_10_and_11_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles
For the Employment Tribunal , the rights and freedoms enshrined in those Articles were fundamental in a democratic society , with the particular exception of incitement to violence , which was not constituted , in the tribunal’s view , by Article 2 ( b ) of Eğitim constitution .	Employment_Tribunal-NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Turkish_employment_tribunal##LKIF:Public_Body rights_and_freedoms-##wordnet_right_105174653 Articles-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles democratic_society-##wordnet_political_system_108367880 Article-##wordnet_article_106392935 2-##wordnet_article_106392935 (_b_)-##wordnet_article_106392935 Eğitim_constitution-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution
By contrast , the combined divisions of the Court of Cassation emphasised the exceptions provided for by PARAGRAPH_REF of Article 11 of the Convention .	Court_of_Cassation-Court_of_Cassation_(Turkey)##wordnet_court_108329453 Article_11_of_the_Convention-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_11_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles
They took the view that Eğitim-Sen’s wish to defend education in a mother tongue other than Turkish ran counter to Articles 3 and 42 of the Constitution and the principle of the unitary State .	mother_tongue_other_than_Turkish-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language Articles_3_and_42-##wordnet_article_106392935 Constitution-Turkish_Constitution_of_1961##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution principle_of_the_unitary_State-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle
54 .	
The Court must therefore ascertain whether the findings of the combined divisions of the Court of Cassation can be founded on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 Court_of_Cassation-Court_of_Cassation_(Turkey)##wordnet_court_103649459
It first notes that the wording of Article 2 ( b ) of Eğitim constitution did not contain any incitement to use violence in order to fulfil the aims pursued .	Article_2_(_b_)-##wordnet_article_106392935 Eğitim_constitution-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution
Moreover , the Court of Cassation found that Eğitim-Sen-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_and_Science_Workers'_Union_(Turkey)##wordnet_applicant_109607280 had not encouraged the use of unlawful means for the fulfilment of its objective of enabling Turkish citizens to receive education in a mother tongue other than Turkish .	Court_of_Cassation-Court_of_Cassation_(Turkey)##wordnet_court_108329453 Turkish_citizens-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person mother_tongue_other_than_Turkish-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language
55 .	
In the Court’s view , the principle defended by Eğitim-Sen-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_and_Science_Workers'_Union_(Turkey)##wordnet_applicant_109607280 , according to which individuals making up Turkish society could receive education in a mother tongue other than Turkish , is not incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy .	principle-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle mother_tongue_other_than_Turkish-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language fundamental_principles_of_democracy-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle
It notes that nothing in the impugned Article of Eğitim constitution can be regarded as a call to violence , uprising or any other form of rejection of democratic principles , this being an essential factor to be taken into consideration ( see Freedom and Democracy Party ( ÖZDEP ) v. Turkey [ GC ] , no . 23885/94 , SECTION REF , ECHR 1999‑VIII ) .	Article-##wordnet_article_106392935 Eğitim_constitution-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution democratic_principles-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle Freedom_and_Democracy_Party_(_ÖZDEP_)_v._Turkey_[_GC_]_,_no_._23885/94_,_SECTION_REF_,_ECHR_1999‑VIII-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
It is sufficient to read the content of Article 2 ( b ) of Eğitim constitution , seen in the context of the public debate at the material time .	Article_2_(_b_)-##wordnet_article_106392935 Eğitim_constitution-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution
In this connection , the Court agrees with the reasoning of the public prosecutor , who decided to discontinue the first dissolution proceedings against Eğitim-Sen.-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_and_Science_Workers'_Union_(Turkey)##wordnet_applicant_109607280 At that time , the question of receiving education in one’s mother tongue was being debated publicly and in political parties and was tabled for debate in Parliament ( see PARAGRAPH_REF above ) .

56 .	
The Court recognises that such a proposal may have run counter to majority beliefs in public opinion , certain institutions or certain State organisations , or even to government policy .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 public_opinion-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion institutions-##wordnet_association_108049401 State_organisations-##LKIF:Public_Body government_policy-##wordnet_policy_106523641
That being said , the Court reiterates that it is necessary for the proper functioning of democracy that the various associations or political groups are able to take part in public debates in order to help find solutions to general questions concerning political and public stakeholders of all persuasions ( see Vogt v. Germany , 26 September 1995 , SECTION REF , Series A no . 323 , and United Communist Party of Turkey and Others , cited above , SECTION_REF ) .

57 .	
The Court further notes that it can be seen from the latest European Commission against Racism and Intolerance ( ECRI ) report on Turkey ( see PARAGRAPH_REF above ) that , in addition to children belonging to the minorities covered by the Lausanne Treaty – that is to say , non minorities – receiving education in Turkish , there were other children of Turkish nationality whose mother tongue was not Turkish but Adyghe , Abkhazian or Kurdish .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 European_Commission_against_Racism_and_Intolerance_(_ECRI_)-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission_against_Racism_and_Intolerance##wordnet_commission_101140471 Turkey-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country Lausanne_Treaty-Treaty_of_Lausanne##wordnet_treaty_106773434 non_minorities-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group children_of_Turkish_nationality-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person Turkish-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language Adyghe-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language Abkhazian-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language Kurdish-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language
In this connection it should be pointed out that Law no . 4771 , enacted on 3 August 2002 and amending Law no . 2923 on foreign-language education and the learning of various languages and dialects by Turkish citizens , paved the way for the opening of private schools to teach “languages and dialects [ other than Turkish ] traditionally used by Turkish citizens in their daily lives” .	Law_no_._4771-##wordnet_law_106532330 amending_Law_no_._2923-##wordnet_law_106532330 Turkish_citizens-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person “languages-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language and-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language dialects-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language [-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language other-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language than_Turkish_]-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language Turkish_citizens-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person
The Court observes that this willingness on the part of the legislature to open private courses for the teaching of languages and dialects other than Turkish contrasts with the position of the national authorities in finding that Article 2 ( b ) of Eğitim constitution breached Articles 3 and 42 of the Constitution .

58 .	
The Court is not convinced by the reasoning of the combined divisions of the Court of Cassation , because it was not indicated in the judgment that Eğitim-Sen-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_and_Science_Workers'_Union_(Turkey)##wordnet_applicant_109607280 had carried out illegal activities capable of undermining the unity of the Republic of Turkey .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 Court_of_Cassation-Court_of_Cassation_(Turkey)##wordnet_court_103649459 Republic_of_Turkey-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country
Neither did they indicate that Eğitim-Sen-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_and_Science_Workers'_Union_(Turkey)##wordnet_applicant_109607280 pursued aims that were incompatible with democratic principles or engaged in activities that were in breach of those stipulated in its constitution .	democratic_principles-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle constitution-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution
The Court notes with interest that the Employment Tribunal , for its part , dismissed the second dissolution application on the ground that a decision not to dissolve the union would have the effect of calming the social tension , disorder and antagonism that were prevalent in society , and of restoring social peace ( see PARAGRAPH_REF above ) .

For that reason the Court is of the opinion that the mere presence in the union’s constitution of the term “to receive education in their mother tongue” , without any other element that would indicate or prove that the real aim was different from that stated in the impugned Article of the constitution , can not be incompatible with the principles of democracy .

It notes that Eğitim constitution , in its earlier version , indicated that the union defended the right of all individuals of society “to receive , with equality and freedom , a democratic , secular , scientific and cost-free education in their mother tongue” .

In the Court’s view , such an objective , with the aim of developing the culture of nationals having a mother tongue other than Turkish by providing education in that mother tongue , is not in itself incompatible with national security and does not represent a threat to public order .	mother_tongue_other_than_Turkish-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language mother_tongue-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language
Even supposing that the competent national authorities could have taken the view that education in one’s own mother tongue favoured the culture of a minority , the Court observes that , as it has previously found , the existence of minorities and different cultures in a country is a historical fact that a democratic society must tolerate , or even protect and support , in accordance with the principles of international law ( see Tourkiki Enosi Xanthis and Others v. Greece , no . 26698/05 , SECTION REF , 27 March 2008 ) .	competent_national_authorities-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_national_authority one’s_own_mother_tongue-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language minority-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 minorities_and_different_cultures-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group democratic_society-##wordnet_political_system_108367880 principles_of_international_law-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle Tourkiki_Enosi_Xanthis_and_Others_v._Greece_,_no_._26698/05_,_SECTION_REF_,_27_March_2008-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case

In the light of the foregoing , the Court takes the view that the reasons indicated by the combined divisions of the Court of Cassation were not relevant or sufficient , and that they were not proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued .

It follows that the dissolution proceedings brought against the applicant union , which had the result of obliging it to amend Article 2 ( b ) of its constitution by deleting the term “to receive education in their mother tongue” , can not reasonably be regarded as meeting a “pressing social need” .	dissolution_proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding applicant_union-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 Article_2_(_b_)-##wordnet_article_106392935 constitution-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution mother_tongue”-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language
