THE FACTS	
I .	
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE	
6 .	
The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Slovenska Bistrica .	The_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 Slovenska_Bistrica-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenska_Bistrica##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town
A .	
Proceedings concerning the labour dispute	Proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
7 .	
The case originated in a labour dispute following the applicant’s transfer to a different post within a company providing electro-installation ( hereinafter referred to as “the company” ) .	
Subsequently , the applicant lodged several claims with the Maribor Labour Court requesting , inter alia , the annulment of the transfer decision , and payment of the difference in salary .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490
8 .	
On 16 April 1993 the first-instance court gave a decision upholding the applicant’s claims .	
The company appealed .	
On 16 December 1993 the second-instance court upheld the company’s appeal and remitted the case for fresh examination .	
9 .	
On 16 February 1994 the Maribor Labour Court issued a decision whereby it upheld the applicant’s claims and annulled the transfer decision .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490
It found that the transfer was related to the applicant’s involvement in trade union activities and his efforts to improve human relations in the company .	
The company , in the court’s view , had failed to demonstrate that there were work-related needs which called for a transfer .	
The court adjudicated that the applicant should be paid the difference in salary .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
The company appealed .	
10 .	
On 18 October 1994 the Ljubljana Higher Labour Court upheld the appeal .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490
The three-judge panel , presided over by judge L.F. , found that the first-instance court had failed to provide adequate reasoning in its decision ; in particular , it had failed to explore whether lawful grounds for the transfer existed , such as an increased need for resources with respect to the applicant’s new post .	judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
In the Higher Court’s view , the lower court should examine the director and the chief of commerce as witnesses .	
The case was remitted for fresh examination .	
11 .	
On 25 April 1995 the Maribor Labour Court stayed the proceedings since bankruptcy proceedings had been instituted against the company .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
12 .	
Subsequently , the court repeatedly requested the applicant to inform it of the progress of the proceedings relating to the company’s bankruptcy and to specify whether he still had an interest in pursing the proceedings in his case .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
The applicant supplied the required information concerning the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings on 18 January 1999 , and requested that the proceedings in his case be continued .	The_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
13 .	
On 5 March 1999 the court resumed the proceedings in so far as they concerned the allegedly unlawful transfer to another post and loss of salary , and dismissed the remaining claims .	proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
The applicant lodged an appeal and an appeal on points of law .	The_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 law-##wordnet_law_106532330
Both were rejected .	
14 .	
On 18 February 2002 the Maribor Labour Court , after holding four hearings and examining witnesses , issued a judgment dismissing the applicant’s claims .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490
It found that the applicant’s transfer to a different post within the company had been lawfully based on the company’s need to adapt to changes in the market , and that he was therefore not entitled to any compensation .	
The applicant appealed .	The_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
15 .	
On 29 August 2002 the Ljubljana Higher Labour Court rejected the appeal and upheld the Maribor Labour Court’s judgment .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490
The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law in which he complained about , inter alia , not being present at one of the hearings , and his claims being previously upheld but eventually rejected owing to improper conduct of the court’s proceedings .

16 .	
On 4 November 2003 the Supreme Court , sitting as a panel of five judges , one of whom was judge L.F. , rejected the appeal on points of law , finding that the lower courts had not committed any errors in the application of the procedural rules and that the applicant had been provided with an opportunity to participate in all hearings .	Supreme_Court-European_Court_of_Justice##wordnet_supreme_court_108336188 judges-##wordnet_judge_110225219 judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219 law-##wordnet_law_106532330 the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
It also noted that the previous court’s decisions had been quashed because they had been found to be erroneous .	
Lastly , the Supreme Court found that the relevant substantive law had been properly applied to the facts of the case as established by the lower courts .	Supreme_Court-European_Court_of_Justice##wordnet_supreme_court_108336188 law-##wordnet_law_106532330
17 .	
On 20 January 2004 , the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal in which he disputed the findings of the Supreme Court and complained that the proceedings had been biased because of the involvement of judge L.F. , who had previously decided in favour of the company’s appeal .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 Supreme_Court-European_Court_of_Justice##wordnet_supreme_court_108336188 complained-##wordnet_complaint_106562217 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
18 .	
On 11 March 2005 the Constitutional Court rejected the appeal on procedural grounds , stating that on account of the terminated bankruptcy proceedings against the company and the fact that the company had been deleted from the register of companies , the applicant no longer had any legal interest .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280

19 .	
Further to the Court’s communication of the present application to the respondent Government , the State Attorney’s Office informed the applicant that no settlement offer would be made .	Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
The Office considered that no violation of the right to a trial within a reasonable time had occurred in his case .	violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law
That letter was served on the applicant on 5 February 2009 .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
20 .	
On 2 November 2009 the applicant initiated proceedings before the Celje Local Court , claiming damages for undue delays in the above-mentioned labour proceedings .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
He referred to the Act on the Protection of the Right to a Trial without undue Delay ( “the 2006 Act” ) and on that basis claimed MONEY_EXP for non-pecuniary damage .	
He further claimed MONEY_EXP for non-pecuniary damage on the basis of the Code of Obligations .	
21 .	
The court held a hearing on 24 February 2011 .	
On 14 March 2011 it issued a judgment rejecting the applicant’s claim for MONEY_EXP , finding that it had no basis in law .	law-##wordnet_law_106532330
As regards the claim for MONEY_EXP , the court found that it had jurisdiction to decide on it as the case fell under section 25 of the 2006 Act .	
However , the court dismissed the claim as it had been lodged outside the six-month time-limit provided for by PARAGRAPH_REF of section 25 of the 2006 Act .	
It found that the applicant had received the letter from the State Attorney’s Office on 5 February 2009 and should therefore have lodged the compensation claim under the 2006 Act no later than 5 August 2009 .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280

The applicant complained that one of the judges involved in the proceedings concerning his appeal on points of law could not be considered impartial because of his prior involvement in the case as a judge of the Higher Court .

The parties’ arguments	parties’-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_(law)##wordnet_party_110402824
25 .	
The Government pleaded non-exhaustion of domestic remedies , submitting that the applicant had failed to avail himself of a claim under the first paragraph of section 4 , read together with section 33 , of the Administrative Disputes Act .	The_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government pleaded-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleading##wordnet_pleading_106559365 the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 claim-##wordnet_claim_105175904 Administrative_Disputes_Act-NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Administrative_Disputes_Act##wordnet_act_106532095
The Government maintained that while the applicant could not have obtained the quashing of the impugned decisions , the Administrative Court could have found a violation of his human rights and awarded compensation for any damage sustained .	The_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 Administrative_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_court##wordnet_court_103649459 violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law human_rights-##wordnet_human_right_105176846
In support of their argument , the Government referred to the case-law of the Administrative Court which they had submitted in the case of Mandić and Jović ( cited above , SECTION_REF ) .	the_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government Administrative_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_court##wordnet_court_103649459 submitted-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deference case_of_Mandić_and_Jović-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
26 .	
The applicant disputed that objection .	The_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
He argued that the claim referred to by the Government could only be lodged in respect of acts and actions , and only when no other judicial proceedings were possible .	claim-##wordnet_claim_105175904 the_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government judicial_proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
There was an established practice whereby breaches of procedural rules had to be claimed in the proceedings in which they had allegedly been committed .	proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
He referred to the case-law of the Supreme Court , in particular its decision of 13 December 2007 ( Up 726/2007 ) .	Supreme_Court-European_Court_of_Justice##wordnet_supreme_court_108336188
In that decision , the Supreme Court had upheld the Administrative Court’s rejection of a claim of violation of human rights lodged under section 4 of the Administrative Disputes Act in which the claimant had complained that the judge in her civil case had not been appointed in accordance with the law .	Supreme_Court-European_Court_of_Justice##wordnet_supreme_court_108336188 Administrative_Court’s-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_court##wordnet_court_103649459 violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law Administrative_Disputes_Act-NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Administrative_Disputes_Act##wordnet_act_106532095 complained-##wordnet_complaint_106562217 judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219 law-##wordnet_law_106532330
The Supreme Court had found that the claimant had had judicial protection at her disposal within the main proceedings before the ordinary courts .	Supreme_Court-European_Court_of_Justice##wordnet_supreme_court_108336188 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
It pointed to the established case-law of the higher courts and the Supreme Court .	Supreme_Court-European_Court_of_Justice##wordnet_supreme_court_108336188
The case-law indicated that the courts of general jurisdiction should decide on matters of violation of the right to an impartial tribunal within their system of ordinary remedies .	violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law
A reference was also made to the practice of the Constitutional Court which required the remedies available in the proceedings under general jurisdiction to be exhausted before a constitutional appeal concerning the right to a fair trial allegedly violated therein could be lodged .

The applicant further submitted that the provisions in questions were not meant to address situations such as his .	The_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 submitted-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deference
It was unclear even when the thirty-day deadline for lodging such a claim would start to run .	
Moreover , the applicant argued that the Government had submitted no relevant case-law to support their assertions .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 the_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government submitted-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deference

The Court’s assessment	
28 .	
The Court reiterates that , in accordance with Article 35 of the Convention , it is not required to decide whether or not the facts alleged by an applicant disclose any appearance of a violation unless all domestic remedies have been exhausted according to the generally recognised rules of international law .	The_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 Article_35_of_the_Convention-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_35_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law law-##wordnet_law_106532330
It falls to a Government pleading non-exhaustion to prove that the remedy in question was available to the applicant in theory and in practice at the material time .	Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
Once this burden of proof has been discharged , it is incumbent on the applicant to establish that the remedy relied on by the Government was in fact exhausted or was inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case , or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement ( see Lukenda v. Slovenia , no .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 the_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government
23032/02 , SECTION_REF , ECHR 2005‑X ) .	
29 .	
The Court notes that a claim under the first paragraph of section 4 , read together with section 33 , of the Administrative Disputes Act , is conditional on a number of elements , one of them being that the action concerned had resulted in the unlawful hindrance , limitation or prevention of the enjoyment of a human right , and another being the absence of any other judicial protection .	The_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 Administrative_Disputes_Act-NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Administrative_Disputes_Act##wordnet_act_106532095
It is not for the Court to speculate on the possible interpretation of the provisions concerned in the context of an alleged violation of the fair trial guarantees in court proceedings .	the_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
It notes that the applicant referred to a decision of the Supreme Court ( see PARAGRAPH_REF above ) which raised serious doubts that a claim before the Administrative Court would provide redress in cases such as the present one .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 Supreme_Court-European_Court_of_Justice##wordnet_supreme_court_108336188 Administrative_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_court##wordnet_court_103649459
The Court understands from the material submitted to it that when the alleged violation occurred in the proceedings before the Supreme Court , a constitutional appeal , and not a claim before the Administrative Court , would have been the appropriate avenue of redress .	The_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 submitted-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deference violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding Supreme_Court-European_Court_of_Justice##wordnet_supreme_court_108336188 Administrative_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_court##wordnet_court_103649459
In the present case the applicant did avail himself of that remedy but was unsuccessful for reasons outside his control , such as the company’s bankruptcy .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
30 .	
Finding that the Government failed to prove that a claim to the Administrative Court was available to the applicant in theory and in practice at the material time , the Court concludes that their objection must be rejected ( see , mutatis mutandis , Mandić and Jović , cited above , SECTION_REF , and Belinger v. Slovenia ( dec. ) , no .	the_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government Administrative_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_court##wordnet_court_103649459 the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 the_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490
42320/98 , 2 October 2001 ) .	
31 .	
The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 SECTION_REF ( a ) of the Convention .	The_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 complaint-##wordnet_complaint_106562217 Article_35-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_35_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles the_Convention-European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##wordnet_convention_106774316
It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds .	
It must therefore be declared admissible .

The parties’ arguments	
32 .	
The applicant argued that the fact that judge L.F. had decided on his appeal on points of law was an absolute breach of the procedural legislation and should have led to the quashing of the Supreme Court’s judgment .	The_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219 law-##wordnet_law_106532330 Supreme_Court’s-European_Court_of_Justice##wordnet_supreme_court_108336188
He further argued that the fact that the Supreme Court did not appear impartial was enough to find a violation of the right to a fair trial .	Supreme_Court-European_Court_of_Justice##wordnet_supreme_court_108336188 violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law
33 .	
The Government admitted that the fact that the same judge had participated in two stages of the proceedings was contrary to sections 70 and 71 of the Civil Procedure Code .	The_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
However , the conduct of judge L.F. disclosed no actual bias .	judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
The Government also argued that nine years had passed between judge L.F.’s first involvement in the case and his second , and that the circumstances of the case had significantly changed in the meantime .	The_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
Moreover , the Supreme Court had assessed an aspect of the case which was entirely different from the one assessed by the panel of the Higher Court of which judge L.F. had been a member .

The Court’s assessment	
34 .	
According to the Court’s constant case-law , when the impartiality of a tribunal for the purposes of Article 6 SECTION_REF is being determined , regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge in a given case – the subjective approach – as well as to whether sufficient guarantees were afforded to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect – the objective approach ( see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [ GC ] , no .	Article_6-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_6_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
73797/01 , SECTION_REF , ECHR 2005‑ ... , and Fatullayev v. Azerbaijan , no .	
40984/07 , SECTION_REF , 22 April 2010 ) .	
35 .	
Firstly , as to the subjective test , the tribunal must be subjectively free of personal prejudice or bias .	
In this regard , the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary ( see , among other authorities , Padovani v. Italy , 26 February 1993 , SECTION_REF , Series A no .	judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
257-B , and Morel v. France , no .	
34130/96 , SECTION_REF , ECHR 2000-VI ) .	
In the present case , in the absence of any evidence to the contrary , there is no reason to doubt judge L.F.’s personal impartiality .	judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
36 .	
Secondly , under the objective test , it must be determined whether , quite apart from the judge’s personal conduct , there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his impartiality ( see Micallef v. Malta [ GC ] , no .	
17056/06 , SECTION_REF , ECHR 2009 ) , since “justice must not only be done ; it must also be seen to be done” .	
In this regard , even appearances may be of a certain importance .	
What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public ( see De Cubber v. Belgium , 26 October 1984 , SECTION_REF , Series A no .	
86 ) .	
Accordingly , any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw .	judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality , the standpoint of the party concerned is important but not decisive .	judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified ( see , among many other authorities , Micallef , cited above , SECTION_REF ) .	
37 .	
When determining the objective justification for the applicant’s fear , such factors as the judge’s dual role in the proceedings , the time which elapsed between the two participations , and the extent to which the judge was involved in the proceedings may be taken into consideration ( see , Švarc and Kavnik v. Slovenia , no .	proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding

32181/04 and 35122/05 , SECTION_REF , 21 July 2011 ) .	
38 .	
In this regard , the Court observes that judge L.F. presided over the panel of the Higher Court which upheld the opposite party’s appeal against a judgment that had been issued in the applicant’s favour .	the_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219 Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490
It remitted the case for fresh examination .	
The applicant’s claim was subsequently rejected by the first-instance court and he appealed unsuccessfully to the Higher Court .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490
He then lodged an appeal on points of law , which was rejected by the panel of the Supreme Court , of which judge L.F. was a member .	law-##wordnet_law_106532330 Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
The Court acknowledges that nine years elapsed between the date of the judgment adopted by the Higher Court’s panel presided over by judge L.F. and the judgment of the panel of the Supreme Court of which judge L.F. was a member .	The_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219 Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
However , the role played by judge L.F. was very significant at both levels of jurisdiction .	judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
He was the presiding judge in the Higher Court’s panel and a member , or even the rapporteur – this was alleged by the applicant and not disputed by the Government – of the Supreme Court panel .	judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219 the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 the_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490
The judgements reached on both occasions concerned the merits of the case and were unfavourable to the applicant .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
Therefore , the Court finds that the impartiality of the “tribunal” was open to doubt , not only in the eyes of the applicant but also objectively .	the_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
39 .	
The Court would note that there is no indication in the case-file that judge L.F. was aware of or reminded of her prior involvement in this particular case .	The_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219
It observes , however , that there is a risk of problems arising in a system which lacks safeguards to ensure that judges are reminded of their prior involvement in particular cases , above all where such matters rely on the judges’ own assessment ( see Puolitaival and Pirttiaho v. Finland , no .	judges-##wordnet_judge_110225219
54857/00 , SECTION_REF , 23 November 2004 , and Švarc and Kavnik , cited above , SECTION_REF ) .

There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 SECTION REF of the Convention .	violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law Article_6_SECTION_REF_of_the_Convention-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_6_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles

The applicant complained under Article 6 SECTION_REF that the proceedings had also been unfair in that the Constitutional Court had failed to deal with his complaint concerning a lack of impartiality on the part of judge L.F .

In particular , he disputed the Constitutional Court’s opinion that the applicant had lost his legal interest in the matter on account of the bankruptcy of the opposite party in the proceedings .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding

44 .	
Having regard to the finding relating to the issue of judge L. F’s lack of impartiality ( see PARAGRAPH_REF and 34-40 above ) , the Court does not find it necessary to asses also the Constitutional Court’s role in ensuring that the applicant had a fair trial before an impartial tribunal .	judge-##wordnet_judge_110225219 the_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280

45 .	
The applicant further complained that the labour proceedings had been unreasonably long and that the remedies available in Slovenia in respect of excessively long proceedings were ineffective .	The_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 complained-##wordnet_complaint_106562217 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
Article 6 of the Convention provides in so far as relevant :	Article_6_of_the_Convention-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_6_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles

46 .	
The Government objected that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies as he had lodged a claim for compensation outside the statutory time-limit .	The_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
They argued that the local court had clearly taken the position that the claim under the 2006 Act would have been admissible had the applicant complied with the time-limit .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
The applicant did not comment on the issue .	The_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
47 .	
The Court notes that the applicant lodged a claim in which he claimed compensation for damage sustained on account of the allegedly undue length of the proceedings , relying in part on the 2006 Act and in part on the Code of Obligations .	The_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
The Court observes that it has already been established that the Code of Obligations did not provide for effective remedies with respect to complaints of undue length of proceedings ( see Lukenda , cited above , SECTION_REF ) .	The_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
However , the 2006 Act , on which the applicant also relied in his claim , provided for a special compensatory remedy which was found in Korenjak v. Slovenia ( ( dec. ) , no .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
463/03 , 15 May 2007 ) and Carević v. Slovenia ( ( dec. ) , no .	
17314/03 , 3 June 2008 ) to constitute an appropriate means of redressing a violation of the right to have one’s case examined within a reasonable time .	violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law
The Court further notes that the Ljubljana Local Court took the position that section 25 of the 2006 Act , which concerned transitional rules , applied to the proceedings in question and that the compensation claim would have been admissible in the applicant’s case if it had been lodged within the statutory time-limit .	The_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding
In this connection , the Court observes that applicants must comply with the applicable rules and procedures of domestic law when making use of domestic remedies ( see Beguš v. Slovenia , no .	the_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 applicants-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 law-##wordnet_law_106532330
25634/05 , SECTION_REF , 15 December 2011 , and Ben Salah , Araqui and Dhaime v. Spain ( dec. ) , no .	
45023/98 , ECHR 2000-IV ) , and finds that the present applicant failed to do so .	applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
The Government’s objection concerning the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies as regards the complaint of undue delays under Article 6 SECTION_REF must therefore be upheld ( Article 35 SECTION REF of the Convention ) .	complaint-##wordnet_complaint_106562217 Article_6-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_6_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles Article_35_SECTION_REF_of_the_Convention-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_35_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles
48 .	
Having regard to the finding above that the applicant had an effective remedy at his disposal but failed to use it properly , the Court concludes that his complaint under Article 13 is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 SECTION_REF ( a ) of the Convention .	the_applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 the_Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 complaint-##wordnet_complaint_106562217 Article_13-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_13_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles Article_35-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_35_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles the_Convention-European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##wordnet_convention_106774316
49 .	
This part of the application must therefore be rejected under Article 35 SECTION REF of the Convention .

The Government argued that the claims were unsubstantiated .	The_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government

The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged ; it therefore rejects this claim .

Costs and expenses

The Government disputed the claim .	The_Government-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovenia##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government

According to the Court’s case-law , an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum .	applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
The Court notes that in the present case the applicant did not explain his claim or submit supporting documents or detailed information showing that the costs claimed had been actually and necessarily incurred ( see S.I .
