( a ) General Principles	
83 .	
The Court has already held that rape amounts to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention ( see Aydın v. Turkey and M.C . v. Bulgaria , cited above ) .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 rape-##wordnet_rape_100773402 Article_3_of_the_Convention-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_3_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles Aydın_v._Turkey_and_M.C_._v._Bulgaria_,-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
84 .	
The relevant principles as to the existence of a positive obligation to punish rape and to investigate rape cases have been enunciated in the case of M.C . v. Bulgaria as follows :	principles-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle positive_obligation_to_punish_rape_and_to_investigate_rape_cases-##wordnet_obligation_106773150 case_of_M.C_._v._Bulgaria-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
“149 .	
The Court reiterates that the obligation of the High Contracting Parties under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention , taken together with Article 3 , requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to ill-treatment-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse , including ill administered by private individuals ( see A. v. the United Kingdom , judgment of 23 September 1998 , Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 , p. 2699 , SECTION REF ; Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [ GC ] , no . 29392/95 , SECTION REF , ECHR Z_and_Others_v._the_United_Kingdom_[_GC_]_,_no_._29392/95_,_SECTION_REF_,_ECHR_2001-V-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case ; and E. and Others v. the United Kingdom , no . 33218/96 , 26 November 2002 ) .

150 .	
Positive obligations on the State are inherent in the right to effective respect for private life under Article 8 ; these obligations may involve the adoption of measures even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves .	Positive_obligations-##wordnet_obligation_106773150 State-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government right_to_effective_respect_for_private_life-##wordnet_right_105174653 Article_8-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_8_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles obligations-##wordnet_obligation_106773150
While the choice of the means to secure compliance with Article 8 in the sphere of protection against acts of individuals is in principle within the State’s margin of appreciation , effective deterrence against grave acts such as rape , where fundamental values and essential aspects of private life are at stake , requires efficient criminal-law provisions .	Article_8-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_8_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles State’s_margin_of_appreciation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_appreciation deterrence_against_grave_acts-##wordnet_deterrence_101076488 rape-##wordnet_rape_100773402 provisions-##wordnet_provision_106755947
Children and other vulnerable individuals , in particular , are entitled to effective protection ( see X and Y v. the Netherlands , judgment of 26 March 1985 , Series A no . 91 , pp . 11 , SECTION REF , and August v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ) , no . 36505/02 , 21 January 2003 ) .	X_and_Y_v._the_Netherlands_,_judgment_of_26_March_1985_,_Series_A_no_._91_,_pp_._11_,_SECTION_REF-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case August_v._the_United_Kingdom_(_dec._)_,_no_._36505/02_,_21_January_2003-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
151 .	
In a number of cases , Article 3 of the Convention gives rise to a positive obligation to conduct an official investigation ( see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria , judgment of 28 October 1998 , Reports 1998 , p. 3290 , SECTION REF ) .	Article_3_of_the_Convention-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_3_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles positive_obligation-##wordnet_obligation_106773150 investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation Assenov_and_Others_v._Bulgaria_,_judgment_of_28_October_1998_,_Reports_1998_,_p._3290_,_SECTION_REF-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
Such a positive obligation can not be considered in principle to be limited solely to cases of ill by State agents ( see , mutatis mutandis , Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy [ GC ] , no . 32967/96 , ECHR Calvelli_and_Ciglio_v._Italy_[_GC_]_,_no_._32967/96_,_ECHR_2002-I-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case ) .	positive_obligation-##wordnet_obligation_106773150 ill_by_State_agents-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse
152 .	
Further , the Court has not excluded the possibility that the State’s positive obligation under Article 8 to safeguard the individual’s physical integrity may extend to questions relating to the effectiveness of a criminal investigation ( see Osman v. the United Kingdom , judgment of 28 October 1998 , Reports 1998 , p. 3164 , SECTION REF , ) .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 State’s_positive_obligation-##wordnet_obligation_106773150 Article_8-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_8_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles criminal-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation Osman_v._the_United_Kingdom_,_judgment_of_28_October_1998_,_Reports_1998_,_p._3164_,_SECTION_REF-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
153 .	
On that basis , the Court considers that States have a positive obligation inherent in Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention to enact criminal provisions effectively punishing rape and to apply them in practice through effective investigation and prosecution.”	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 States-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government positive_obligation-##wordnet_obligation_106773150 Articles_3_and_8_of_the_Convention-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_3_and_8_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles criminal_provisions-##wordnet_provision_106755947 rape-##wordnet_rape_100773402 investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation prosecution.”-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Prosecution
85 .	
Even though the scope of the State’s positive obligations might differ between cases where treatment contrary to Article 3 has been inflicted through the involvement of State agents and cases where violence has been inflicted by private individuals , the requirements as to an official investigation are similar .	State’s_positive_obligations-##wordnet_obligation_106773150 Article_3-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_3_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles State_agents-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation
For the investigation to be regarded as “effective” , it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible .	the_investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation identification-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Identification_of_responsible punishment-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment
This is not an obligation of result , but one of means .	obligation-##wordnet_obligation_106773150
The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident , including , inter alia , eyewitness testimony , forensic evidence , and so on .	authorities-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government evidence-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_(law) eyewitness_testimony-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_(law) forensic_evidence-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_(law)
Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard , and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context .	the_investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation identity_of_the_persons_responsible-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Identification_of_responsible
In cases under Article 3 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue , the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time .	Article_3_of_the_Convention-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_3_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 authorities-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government complaints-##wordnet_complaint_106562217
Consideration has been given to the opening of investigations , delays in taking statements , and to the length of time taken for the initial investigation ( see Denis Vasilyev v. Russia , no . 32704/04 , SECTION REF , 17 December 2009 with further references , and Stoica v. Romania , no . 42722/02 , SECTION REF , 4 March 2008 ) .	investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation Denis_Vasilyev_v._Russia_,_no_._32704/04_,_SECTION_REF_,_17_December_2009-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case Stoica_v._Romania_,_no_._42722/02_,_SECTION_REF_,_4_March_2008-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
86 .	
The Court further emphasises the primary duty of the State to secure the right not to be exposed to treatment contrary to Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention or , in the context of the present case , to attacks on one’s personal integrity , by putting in place an appropriate legal and administrative framework to deter the commission of offences against the person , backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention , suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions ( see Sandra Janković v. Croatia , no . 38478/05 , SECTION REF , 5 March 2009 ; and Beganović v. Croatia , no . 46423/06 , SECTION REF , 25 June 2009 ) .

( b ) Application of these principles to the circumstances of the present case	present-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
87 .	
As to the criminal-law mechanisms provided in the Croatian legal system , the Court notes that rape is a criminal offence under the Criminal Code and includes not only forced sexual intercourse but other sexual acts as well .	Croatian_legal_system-NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Croatian_legal_system##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_legal_systems Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 rape-##wordnet_rape_100773402 criminal_offence-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime Criminal_Code-NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Croatian_Criminal_Code##wordnet_penal_code_106668019
The Court observes further that the Croatian criminal law distinguishes between criminal offences to be prosecuted by the State Attorney’s Office , either of its own motion or upon a private application , and criminal offences to be prosecuted by means of a private prosecution .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 Croatian_criminal_law-NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Croatian_criminal_law##wordnet_criminal_law_106539178 criminal_offences-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime State_Attorney’s_Office-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State's_Attorney_Office_of_the_Republic_of_Croatia##LKIF:Public_Body criminal_offences-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime private_prosecution-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Prosecution
The latter category concerns criminal offences of a lesser nature .	criminal_offences-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime
The Court also notes that the applicant alleged that she had been raped .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
Prosecution in respect of that offence is to be undertaken by the State Attorney’s Office of its own motion .

88 .	
The Court further observes that the Croatian legal system also provides for the injured party to act as a subsidiary prosecutor .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 Croatian_legal_system-NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Croatian_legal_system##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_legal_systems party-##wordnet_party_110402824 subsidiary_prosecutor-##wordnet_prosecutor_110484858
In respect of criminal offences for which the prosecution is to be undertaken by the State Attorney’s Office , either of its own motion or upon a private application , where that Office declines to prosecute , on whatever ground , the injured party may take over the prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor .	criminal_offences-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime State_Attorney’s_Office-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State's_Attorney_Office_of_the_Republic_of_Croatia##LKIF:Public_Body private_application-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Application Office-Atlético_Celayahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State's_Attorney_Office_of_the_Republic_of_Croatia##LKIF:Public_Body injured_party-##wordnet_party_110402824 prosecution-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Prosecution subsidiary_prosecutor-##wordnet_prosecutor_110484858
89 .	
The Court will next examine whether or not the impugned regulations and practices , and in particular the domestic authorities’ compliance with the relevant procedural rules , as well as the manner in which the criminal-law mechanisms were implemented in the instant case , were defective to the point of constituting a violation of the respondent State’s positive obligations under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention .

90 .	
In this connection , the Court firstly observes that the national authorities established that I.Z. , the police officer assigned to the case , had not undertaken all necessary steps in the initial phase of the police enquiry .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 national_authorities-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_national_authority I.Z.-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer police_enquiry-##wordnet_inquiry_100636728
Thus , their findings were that he “did not order an in situ inspection ; nor did he take a statement from the injured party or conduct a detailed informative interview with her ... nor did he take the clothes that the injured party and the suspect were wearing in order to give them for forensic examination ... ” ( see PARAGRAPH_REF above ) .	party-##wordnet_party_110402824 forensic_examination-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Examination
91 .	
At this juncture the Court considers it appropriate to reiterate the principles concerning the victim status of an applicant .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 principles-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
In this regard the Court observes that under Article 34 of the Convention it “may receive applications from any person ... claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto” .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 Article_34_of_the_Convention-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_34_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights$Convention_articles applications-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Application violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law High_Contracting_Parties-Atlético_Celayahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_Council_of_Europe##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_(law) rights-##wordnet_human_right_105176846 the_Convention-European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##wordnet_convention_106774316 Protocols-##wordnet_protocol_105668915
It falls first to the national authorities to redress any alleged violation of the Convention .	national_authorities-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_national_authority violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law the_Convention-European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##wordnet_convention_106774316
In this connection , the question whether an applicant can claim to be a victim of the violation alleged is relevant at all stages of the proceedings under the Convention ( see Burdov v. Russia , no . 59498/00 , SECTION REF , ECHR Burdov_v._Russia_,_no_._59498/00_,_SECTION_REF_,_ECHR_2002-III-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case , and Trepashkin v. Russia , no . 36898/03 , SECTION REF , 19 July 2007 ) .	applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_proceeding the_Convention-European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##wordnet_convention_106774316 Trepashkin_v._Russia_,_no_._36898/03_,_SECTION_REF_,_19_July_2007-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
92 .	
The Court also reiterates that a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him or her of his or her status as a “victim” unless the national authorities have acknowledged , either expressly or in substance , and then afforded redress for , the breach of the Convention ( see Amuur v. France , 25 June 1996 , SECTION REF , Reports Amuur_v._France_,_25_June_1996_,_SECTION_REF_,_Reports_1996-III-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case , and Dalban v. Romania [ GC ] , no . 28114/95 , SECTION REF , ECHR Dalban_v._Romania_[_GC_]_,_no_._28114/95_,_SECTION_REF_,_ECHR_1999-VI-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case ) .

Such acknowledgment and redress are usually the result of the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies ( see Koç and Tambaş v. Turkey ( dec. ) , no . 46947/99 , 24 February 2005 ) .	Koç_and_Tambaş_v._Turkey_(_dec._)_,_no_._46947/99_,_24_February_2005-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
93 .	
The Court further reiterates that the machinery for the protection of fundamental rights established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 fundamental_rights-##wordnet_right_105174653 the_Convention-European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##wordnet_convention_106774316 national-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_legal_systems systems-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_legal_systems
The Convention does not lay down for the Contracting States any given manner for ensuring within their internal law the effective implementation of the Convention .	The_Convention-European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##wordnet_convention_106774316 the_Convention-European_Convention_on_Human_Rights##wordnet_convention_106774316
The choice as to the most appropriate means of achieving this is in principle a matter for the domestic authorities , who are in continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries and are better placed to assess the possibilities and resources afforded by their respective domestic legal systems ( see Swedish Engine Drivers’ Union v. Sweden , 6 February 1976 , SECTION REF , Series A no . 20 ; Chapman v. the United Kingdom [ GC ] , no . 27238/95 , SECTION REF , ECHR Chapman_v._the_United_Kingdom_[_GC_]_,_no_._27238/95_,_SECTION_REF_,_ECHR_2001-I-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case ; and Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia [ GC ] , no . 60654/00 , SECTION REF , ECHR Sisojeva_and_Others_v._Latvia_[_GC_]_,_no_._60654/00_,_SECTION_REF_,_ECHR_2007-II-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case ) .

94 .	
In the Court’s view , the finding that police officers F.C . and I.Z . had failed to conduct the initial police enquiry into the applicant’s allegations of rape in a satisfactory manner , and that officer I.Z . did not collect all the relevant evidence amounts to an acknowledgment that at the initial stage the investigation into the applicant’s allegations of rape was flawed and lacked the required thoroughness .	police_officers_F.C-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer I.Z-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer initial_police_enquiry-##wordnet_inquiry_100636728 applicant’s_allegations_of_rape-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegation officer_I.Z-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer relevant_evidence_amounts-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_(law) the_investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation applicant’s_allegations_of_rape-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegation
95 .	
The Court also notes that section 13 of the State Administration Act provides for the possibility of seeking compensation from the State in respect of omissions by State officials .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 section_13_of_the_State_Administration_Act-##wordnet_law_106532330 State-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Government##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state State_officials-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency
In the Court’s , view , the finding that officer I.Z . had committed a grave breach of his official duty , defined as a “failure to act or untimely or reckless conduct or conduct lacking diligence in the carrying out of his official duties” gave good grounds to the applicant for lodging a compensation claim against the State .	officer_I.Z-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer official_duty-##LKIF:Obligation applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 compensation_claim-##wordnet_claim_105175904 State-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Government##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state
While the above-mentioned flaws at the initial stage of the police enquiry , when evidence had to be secured , certainly undermined the possibility of establishing the facts of the case with more certainty in any further investigation , the fact that they were acknowledged by the national authorities leads the Court to conclude that the issue of the conduct of the police during the initial stages of the enquiry into the applicant’s allegations of rape has been adequately addressed by the national bodies .	police_enquiry-##wordnet_inquiry_100636728 evidence-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_(law) investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation national_authorities-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_national_authority Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 enquiry-##wordnet_inquiry_100636728 applicant’s_allegations_of_rape-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegation national_bodies-##LKIF:Public_Body
Such an assessment , coupled with the possibility for the applicant to seek compensation from the State in that regard , shows that there exists a system of redress in the national law for the breach of official duty .	assessment-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_assessment applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 State-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Government##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state national-NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Croatian_legal_system##wordnet_law_106532330 law-NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Croatian_legal_system##wordnet_law_106532330 official-##LKIF:Obligation

However , this can not satisfy the requirement of an effective investigation .	investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation
These initial flaws necessarily had an impact on the effectiveness of the entire investigation .	investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation
The applicant made further complaints as regards the effectiveness of the investigation , such as the fact that the skirt she had been wearing on the occasion at issue had never been sent for forensic examination ; that witness Ve.M. , who allegedly had some knowledge about her underwear being found on the boat ( see above , SECTION_REF ) , [ 9 ] had not been heard ; and those concerning the position of Judge S.G. , who acted as the investigating judge in the case at issue .	applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 the_investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation forensic_examination-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Examination witness-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness Judge_S.G.-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examining_magistrate investigating_judge-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examining_magistrate case-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case
Thus , the applicant may still claim to be a victim of the violation claimed .	applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 violation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violation_of_law

In this respect the role of Judge S.G. in the investigation of the applicant’s allegations of rape should be addressed .

In this regard , the Court notes that when an investigating judge receives a request for opening an investigation from the State Attorney’s Office , he or she has to hear the suspect and then decide , on the basis of the evidence contained in the request , whether he or she agrees with such a request .

In the case to the contrary the investigating judge issues a decision expressing his or her disagreement with the request for the opening of the investigation ( Articles 189 and 190 of the Code on Criminal Procedure ) .	investigating_judge-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examining_magistrate request-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint the_investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation Code_on_Criminal_Procedure-NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_European_code_on_criminal_procedure##wordnet_legal_code_106667792

In the present case Judge S.G. , acting as the investigating judge , disagreed with the request to open an investigation into the applicant’s allegations of rape in respect of D.Š .	case-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case Judge_S.G.-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examining_magistrate investigating_judge-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examining_magistrate request-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint an_investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation applicant’s_allegations_of_rape-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegation D.Š-##wordnet_party_110402824
He based his disagreement on the written police records of the interviews carried out with the persons present at the scene at the time when the police arrived , the medical report drawn up by the gynaecologist who examined the applicant on the same day , and the oral evidence given by D.Š .	written_police_records-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Police_records police-##wordnet_police_108209687 medical-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record gynaecologist-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 oral_evidence-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_(law) D.Š-##wordnet_party_110402824

The Court does not consider that in every instance where an investigating judge who has initially expressed his or her disagreement with the request for an investigation later conducts the investigation in the same case lacks impartiality .

Each case warrants an assessment of the judge’s impartiality in view of all the circumstances .	
100 .	
In the present case the investigating judge disagreed with the request by the S. County State Attorney’s Office to open an investigation in respect of D.Š .	investigating_judge-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examining_magistrate S._County_State_Attorney’s_Office-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State's_Attorney_Office_of_the_Republic_of_Croatia##LKIF:Public_Body an_investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation D.Š-##wordnet_party_110402824
in connection with the applicant’s allegations of rape .	applicant’s_allegations_of_rape-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegation
He voiced quite a strong opinion of the applicant and largely based his disagreement on the applicant’s conduct ( see PARAGRAPH_REF above ) .	applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280
101 .	
In this connection , it is to be reiterated that the Court attaches significant importance to appearances in matters of criminal justice , since justice must not just be done but must be seen to be done .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490
What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public ( see , mutatis mutandis , Borgers v. Belgium , 30 October 1991 , SECTION REF , Series A no . 214‑B , and Mirilashvili v. Russia , no . 6293/04 , SECTION REF , 11 December 2008 ) .

Such considerations equally concern the accused and the injured parties in criminal proceedings .	accused-##wordnet_party_110402824 injured_parties-##wordnet_party_110402824 criminal_proceedings-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure
Thus , the Court stresses that the allegation that a rape victim was under the influence of alcohol or other circumstances concerning the victim’s behaviour or personality can not dispense the authorities from the obligation to effectively investigate .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 allegation-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegation obligation_to_effectively-##wordnet_obligation_106773150
102 .	
The Court also notes that the investigating judge concluded as follows : “The criminal complaint and the enclosures in the case-file show with certainty that the injured party was not , at any moment , alone with the suspect ... ” .	Court-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights##wordnet_trial_court_108336490 investigating_judge-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examining_magistrate complaint-##wordnet_complaint_106562217 injured_party-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_(law)
This choice of words leaves little doubt as to the judge’s view as regards one of the crucial aspects of the case , namely the question whether the applicant and D.Š .	case-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 D.Š-##wordnet_party_110402824
were left alone at any time .	
This strongly worded statement combined with the emphasis on the applicant’s own conduct could raise a question of appearances as to the judge’s objectivity and impartiality in respect of his continued conduct of the investigation .	the_investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation
103 .	
In this context , the Court notes that the applicant made further complaints as to the effectiveness of the investigation , arguing that the authorities had not complied with their obligation to take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident at issue .

The skirt the applicant was wearing on the critical occasion and which she gave to the police of her own accord was never sent for forensic examination .	applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 police-##wordnet_police_108209687 forensic_examination-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Examination
It was also argued that insufficient efforts were made to ensure that witness Ve.M. , [ 10 ] who appeared to have some relevant knowledge , was heard by the investigating judge .	witness_Ve.M.-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness investigating_judge-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examining_magistrate
No in situ inspection was carried out at the time when the police arrived at the scene .	police-##wordnet_police_108209687
Furthermore , the authorities never answered the applicant’s allegations of bias of the investigation judge .	authorities-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_national_authority applicant’s_allegations_of_bias_of_the_investigation_judge-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegation

104 .	
The Court thus finds that in the present case there has been a violation of the procedural aspect of both Article 3 and Article 8 of the Convention and dismisses the Government’s objections as to the applicant’s victim status .

The applicant argued that the victims of sexual violence were mostly women .	applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 sexual_violence-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence

As regards the present case , the investigating judge had acted with prejudice against the applicant when he expressed his disagreement with the request for an investigation and labelled the applicant as merely a person having disturbed public peace and order and consumed a large quantity of alcohol , and ignored the crucial facts of the case .	present_case-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case investigating_judge-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examining_magistrate prejudice-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 request-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint an_investigation-##NOT_IN_WIKIPEDIA_Investigation applicant-##wordnet_applicant_109607280 case-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case

The Court considers that this complaint is closely linked to the one concerning the procedural aspect of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention and must also therefore be declared admissible .
