The Court’s assessment
( a ) General Principles
83 .
The Court has already held that rape amounts to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention ( see Aydın v. Turkey and M.C . v. Bulgaria , cited above ) .
84 .
The relevant principles as to the existence of a positive obligation to punish rape and to investigate rape cases have been enunciated in the case of M.C . v. Bulgaria as follows :
“149 .
The Court reiterates that the obligation of the High Contracting Parties under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention , taken together with Article 3 , requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to ill-treatment-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse , including ill administered by private individuals ( see A. v. the United Kingdom , judgment of 23 September 1998 , Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 , p. 2699 , SECTION REF ; Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [ GC ] , no . 29392/95 , SECTION REF , ECHR Z_and_Others_v._the_United_Kingdom_[_GC_]_,_no_._29392/95_,_SECTION_REF_,_ECHR_2001-V-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case ; and E. and Others v. the United Kingdom , no . 33218/96 , 26 November 2002 ) .
150 .
Positive obligations on the State are inherent in the right to effective respect for private life under Article 8 ; these obligations may involve the adoption of measures even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves .
While the choice of the means to secure compliance with Article 8 in the sphere of protection against acts of individuals is in principle within the State’s margin of appreciation , effective deterrence against grave acts such as rape , where fundamental values and essential aspects of private life are at stake , requires efficient criminal-law provisions .
Children and other vulnerable individuals , in particular , are entitled to effective protection ( see X and Y v. the Netherlands , judgment of 26 March 1985 , Series A no . 91 , pp . 11 , SECTION REF , and August v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ) , no . 36505/02 , 21 January 2003 ) .
151 .
In a number of cases , Article 3 of the Convention gives rise to a positive obligation to conduct an official investigation ( see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria , judgment of 28 October 1998 , Reports 1998 , p. 3290 , SECTION REF ) .
Such a positive obligation can not be considered in principle to be limited solely to cases of ill by State agents ( see , mutatis mutandis , Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy [ GC ] , no . 32967/96 , ECHR Calvelli_and_Ciglio_v._Italy_[_GC_]_,_no_._32967/96_,_ECHR_2002-I-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case ) .
152 .
Further , the Court has not excluded the possibility that the State’s positive obligation under Article 8 to safeguard the individual’s physical integrity may extend to questions relating to the effectiveness of a criminal investigation ( see Osman v. the United Kingdom , judgment of 28 October 1998 , Reports 1998 , p. 3164 , SECTION REF , ) .
153 .
On that basis , the Court considers that States have a positive obligation inherent in Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention to enact criminal provisions effectively punishing rape and to apply them in practice through effective investigation and prosecution.”
85 .
Even though the scope of the State’s positive obligations might differ between cases where treatment contrary to Article 3 has been inflicted through the involvement of State agents and cases where violence has been inflicted by private individuals , the requirements as to an official investigation are similar .
For the investigation to be regarded as “effective” , it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible .
This is not an obligation of result , but one of means .
The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident , including , inter alia , eyewitness testimony , forensic evidence , and so on .
Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard , and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context .
In cases under Article 3 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue , the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time .
Consideration has been given to the opening of investigations , delays in taking statements , and to the length of time taken for the initial investigation ( see Denis Vasilyev v. Russia , no . 32704/04 , SECTION REF , 17 December 2009 with further references , and Stoica v. Romania , no . 42722/02 , SECTION REF , 4 March 2008 ) .
86 .
The Court further emphasises the primary duty of the State to secure the right not to be exposed to treatment contrary to Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention or , in the context of the present case , to attacks on one’s personal integrity , by putting in place an appropriate legal and administrative framework to deter the commission of offences against the person , backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention , suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions ( see Sandra Janković v. Croatia , no . 38478/05 , SECTION REF , 5 March 2009 ; and Beganović v. Croatia , no . 46423/06 , SECTION REF , 25 June 2009 ) .
( b ) Application of these principles to the circumstances of the present case
87 .
As to the criminal-law mechanisms provided in the Croatian legal system , the Court notes that rape is a criminal offence under the Criminal Code and includes not only forced sexual intercourse but other sexual acts as well .
The Court observes further that the Croatian criminal law distinguishes between criminal offences to be prosecuted by the State Attorney’s Office , either of its own motion or upon a private application , and criminal offences to be prosecuted by means of a private prosecution .
The latter category concerns criminal offences of a lesser nature .
The Court also notes that the applicant alleged that she had been raped .
Prosecution in respect of that offence is to be undertaken by the State Attorney’s Office of its own motion .
88 .
The Court further observes that the Croatian legal system also provides for the injured party to act as a subsidiary prosecutor .
In respect of criminal offences for which the prosecution is to be undertaken by the State Attorney’s Office , either of its own motion or upon a private application , where that Office declines to prosecute , on whatever ground , the injured party may take over the prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor .
89 .
The Court will next examine whether or not the impugned regulations and practices , and in particular the domestic authorities’ compliance with the relevant procedural rules , as well as the manner in which the criminal-law mechanisms were implemented in the instant case , were defective to the point of constituting a violation of the respondent State’s positive obligations under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention .
90 .
In this connection , the Court firstly observes that the national authorities established that I.Z. , the police officer assigned to the case , had not undertaken all necessary steps in the initial phase of the police enquiry .
Thus , their findings were that he “did not order an in situ inspection ; nor did he take a statement from the injured party or conduct a detailed informative interview with her ... nor did he take the clothes that the injured party and the suspect were wearing in order to give them for forensic examination ... ” ( see PARAGRAPH_REF above ) .
91 .
At this juncture the Court considers it appropriate to reiterate the principles concerning the victim status of an applicant .
In this regard the Court observes that under Article 34 of the Convention it “may receive applications from any person ... claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto” .
It falls first to the national authorities to redress any alleged violation of the Convention .
In this connection , the question whether an applicant can claim to be a victim of the violation alleged is relevant at all stages of the proceedings under the Convention ( see Burdov v. Russia , no . 59498/00 , SECTION REF , ECHR Burdov_v._Russia_,_no_._59498/00_,_SECTION_REF_,_ECHR_2002-III-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case , and Trepashkin v. Russia , no . 36898/03 , SECTION REF , 19 July 2007 ) .
92 .
The Court also reiterates that a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him or her of his or her status as a “victim” unless the national authorities have acknowledged , either expressly or in substance , and then afforded redress for , the breach of the Convention ( see Amuur v. France , 25 June 1996 , SECTION REF , Reports Amuur_v._France_,_25_June_1996_,_SECTION_REF_,_Reports_1996-III-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case , and Dalban v. Romania [ GC ] , no . 28114/95 , SECTION REF , ECHR Dalban_v._Romania_[_GC_]_,_no_._28114/95_,_SECTION_REF_,_ECHR_1999-VI-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case ) .
Such acknowledgment and redress are usually the result of the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies ( see Koç and Tambaş v. Turkey ( dec. ) , no . 46947/99 , 24 February 2005 ) .
93 .
The Court further reiterates that the machinery for the protection of fundamental rights established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights .
The Convention does not lay down for the Contracting States any given manner for ensuring within their internal law the effective implementation of the Convention .
The choice as to the most appropriate means of achieving this is in principle a matter for the domestic authorities , who are in continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries and are better placed to assess the possibilities and resources afforded by their respective domestic legal systems ( see Swedish Engine Drivers’ Union v. Sweden , 6 February 1976 , SECTION REF , Series A no . 20 ; Chapman v. the United Kingdom [ GC ] , no . 27238/95 , SECTION REF , ECHR Chapman_v._the_United_Kingdom_[_GC_]_,_no_._27238/95_,_SECTION_REF_,_ECHR_2001-I-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case ; and Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia [ GC ] , no . 60654/00 , SECTION REF , ECHR Sisojeva_and_Others_v._Latvia_[_GC_]_,_no_._60654/00_,_SECTION_REF_,_ECHR_2007-II-##https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_case ) .
94 .
In the Court’s view , the finding that police officers F.C . and I.Z . had failed to conduct the initial police enquiry into the applicant’s allegations of rape in a satisfactory manner , and that officer I.Z . did not collect all the relevant evidence amounts to an acknowledgment that at the initial stage the investigation into the applicant’s allegations of rape was flawed and lacked the required thoroughness .
95 .
The Court also notes that section 13 of the State Administration Act provides for the possibility of seeking compensation from the State in respect of omissions by State officials .
In the Court’s , view , the finding that officer I.Z . had committed a grave breach of his official duty , defined as a “failure to act or untimely or reckless conduct or conduct lacking diligence in the carrying out of his official duties” gave good grounds to the applicant for lodging a compensation claim against the State .
While the above-mentioned flaws at the initial stage of the police enquiry , when evidence had to be secured , certainly undermined the possibility of establishing the facts of the case with more certainty in any further investigation , the fact that they were acknowledged by the national authorities leads the Court to conclude that the issue of the conduct of the police during the initial stages of the enquiry into the applicant’s allegations of rape has been adequately addressed by the national bodies .
Such an assessment , coupled with the possibility for the applicant to seek compensation from the State in that regard , shows that there exists a system of redress in the national law for the breach of official duty .
96 .
However , this can not satisfy the requirement of an effective investigation .
These initial flaws necessarily had an impact on the effectiveness of the entire investigation .
The applicant made further complaints as regards the effectiveness of the investigation , such as the fact that the skirt she had been wearing on the occasion at issue had never been sent for forensic examination ; that witness Ve.M. , who allegedly had some knowledge about her underwear being found on the boat ( see above , SECTION_REF ) , [ 9 ] had not been heard ; and those concerning the position of Judge S.G. , who acted as the investigating judge in the case at issue .
Thus , the applicant may still claim to be a victim of the violation claimed .
97 .
In this respect the role of Judge S.G. in the investigation of the applicant’s allegations of rape should be addressed .
In this regard , the Court notes that when an investigating judge receives a request for opening an investigation from the State Attorney’s Office , he or she has to hear the suspect and then decide , on the basis of the evidence contained in the request , whether he or she agrees with such a request .
In the case of his or her consent , the investigating judge issues a decision on the opening of the investigation .
In the case to the contrary the investigating judge issues a decision expressing his or her disagreement with the request for the opening of the investigation ( Articles 189 and 190 of the Code on Criminal Procedure ) .
98 .
In the present case Judge S.G. , acting as the investigating judge , disagreed with the request to open an investigation into the applicant’s allegations of rape in respect of D.Š .
He based his disagreement on the written police records of the interviews carried out with the persons present at the scene at the time when the police arrived , the medical report drawn up by the gynaecologist who examined the applicant on the same day , and the oral evidence given by D.Š .
to the investigating judge .
99 .
The Court does not consider that in every instance where an investigating judge who has initially expressed his or her disagreement with the request for an investigation later conducts the investigation in the same case lacks impartiality .
Each case warrants an assessment of the judge’s impartiality in view of all the circumstances .
100 .
In the present case the investigating judge disagreed with the request by the S. County State Attorney’s Office to open an investigation in respect of D.Š .
in connection with the applicant’s allegations of rape .
He voiced quite a strong opinion of the applicant and largely based his disagreement on the applicant’s conduct ( see PARAGRAPH_REF above ) .
101 .
In this connection , it is to be reiterated that the Court attaches significant importance to appearances in matters of criminal justice , since justice must not just be done but must be seen to be done .
What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public ( see , mutatis mutandis , Borgers v. Belgium , 30 October 1991 , SECTION REF , Series A no . 214‑B , and Mirilashvili v. Russia , no . 6293/04 , SECTION REF , 11 December 2008 ) .
Such considerations equally concern the accused and the injured parties in criminal proceedings .
Thus , the Court stresses that the allegation that a rape victim was under the influence of alcohol or other circumstances concerning the victim’s behaviour or personality can not dispense the authorities from the obligation to effectively investigate .
102 .
The Court also notes that the investigating judge concluded as follows : “The criminal complaint and the enclosures in the case-file show with certainty that the injured party was not , at any moment , alone with the suspect ... ” .
This choice of words leaves little doubt as to the judge’s view as regards one of the crucial aspects of the case , namely the question whether the applicant and D.Š .
were left alone at any time .
This strongly worded statement combined with the emphasis on the applicant’s own conduct could raise a question of appearances as to the judge’s objectivity and impartiality in respect of his continued conduct of the investigation .
103 .
In this context , the Court notes that the applicant made further complaints as to the effectiveness of the investigation , arguing that the authorities had not complied with their obligation to take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident at issue .
The skirt the applicant was wearing on the critical occasion and which she gave to the police of her own accord was never sent for forensic examination .
It was also argued that insufficient efforts were made to ensure that witness Ve.M. , [ 10 ] who appeared to have some relevant knowledge , was heard by the investigating judge .
No in situ inspection was carried out at the time when the police arrived at the scene .
Furthermore , the authorities never answered the applicant’s allegations of bias of the investigation judge .
These objective flaws in the investigation show a passive attitude as to the efforts made to properly probe applicant’s allegations of rape .
104 .
The Court thus finds that in the present case there has been a violation of the procedural aspect of both Article 3 and Article 8 of the Convention and dismisses the Government’s objections as to the applicant’s victim status .
It also holds that no separate issue arises under Article 13 of the Convention .
II .
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION
105 .
The applicant complained that the national authorities involved in the investigation of her allegations of rape had discriminated against her on the basis of her gender .
She relied on Article 14 of the Convention , the relevant part of which reads :
“The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [ the ] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , association with a national minority , property , birth or other status.”
106 .
The applicant argued that the victims of sexual violence were mostly women .
In Croatia the level of sensitivity and specific knowledge of law personnel in this area was quite low and there was no protocol on the procedure to be followed in cases of sexual violence .
As regards the present case , the investigating judge had acted with prejudice against the applicant when he expressed his disagreement with the request for an investigation and labelled the applicant as merely a person having disturbed public peace and order and consumed a large quantity of alcohol , and ignored the crucial facts of the case .
107 .
The Court considers that this complaint is closely linked to the one concerning the procedural aspect of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention and must also therefore be declared admissible .
108 .
The Court finds , however , that this complaint essentially overlaps with the issues which have been examined under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention .
Having found a violation of those provisions , the Court holds that no separate issue arises under Article 14 of the Convention .
III .
APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION
109 .
Article 41 of the Convention provides :
